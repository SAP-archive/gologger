# Go Logger

Simple logging framework for Go

Use the following command to download the framework.

```bash
go get github.infra.hana.ondemand.com/cloudfoundry/gologger
```

Here is a simple demonstration how to use the framework.

```go
gologger.Infof("Hello world, %s!", "Jon Snow")
```

The framework has a few more features, but that is left as an exercise for the reader.
